We used this lego sumo program to participate in the gisutech competition (www.gisutech.com) and we won a gold medal.

What is lego sumo : 
Two self controlled robots compete and try to push their competitor off the field. The field is round and the interiorsurface is painted black and is bordered with a white margin. In each competition two robots compete. One competition consists of three rounds. If there is a lack of time the matches can be shortened to one round instead of three.
